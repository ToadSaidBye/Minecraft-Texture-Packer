# Minecraft-texture-packer
An app used to make a texture pack out of minecraft jars.
Select either a minecraft run (1.18.1.jar) or mod (Biomes-o-blenty.jar).
# How to Use
You first give your pack a name in the first text box.
You then select a jar of either a minecraft file or mod.
You select then if you want to include Vanilla music. This does not work with mods, and still a long way to go in develpment. 
Then, select Make Me A Pack. The app will freeze, but it just means it's working.
When it unfreezes, check your resorce packs folder. A folder should have been created with the pack's name, and all default files in there. 
# Update Plans
1. Finish the music checkbox
2. Make the gui look nicer
# IMPORTANT INFO AND NOTES
You might need to install .NET in order to run this. If you do, you will be told.
Music is still in beta, and does not work 100%
The pack might say it's made for a newer or older version. Ignore it, and it is made for whatever jar you gave it
All files execept the pack.mcmeta that is generated by this app are owned by either Mojang or the mod creator
This app is not made, sponsered by, or related to Mojang AB or Microsoft.
